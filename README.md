# umap_panels_app
Code for Shiny app hosted at https://jfneum.shinyapps.io/umap_panels_app/

Also contains two .csv files to use with the app to test it.

The main purpose of this app - which is limited in function and looks rather ugly - is to showcase how to dynamically update user-facing selection options.
